# BESS Studio — stage register

The live record of the build defined in [`docs/SITE.md` §17](./SITE.md#17-how-this-gets-built).
`SITE.md` is the contract; this file is what actually happened.

> **S0 and S1 are complete and ready for acceptance.** S2 onward are `PLANNED` — not built, not
> tested. No simulation fixture (F01–F08) has been run; writing a check into this file is not
> evidence that it passed.

**Delivery states:** PLANNED → BUILDING → TESTING → READY FOR ACCEPTANCE → ACCEPTED, and **BLOCKED**
when a prerequisite or a mandatory check fails.

**To start a stage**, use the instruction in [§17.3](./SITE.md#173-the-instruction-to-start-a-stage).

## What is already true, and must stay true

The invariants every stage inherits. Breaking one reopens the stage that broke it.

| Invariant | Where it is enforced | Covered by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opening experience unchanged | `src/app/landing/`, `src/app/pages/Start.tsx` | S0 browser walkthrough |
| Single-level release never writes the approval fields | `src/quoting/lifecycle.ts`, `firestore.rules` | unit + rules tests |
| Under `two-step`, sales cannot approve its own quotation | `src/quoting/lifecycle.ts`, `firestore.rules` | unit + rules tests |
| The offer fits four A4 pages for every quotation | `src/app/offerStyles.ts` | S0 fit sweep |
| A customer is never notified about another customer's record | `src/platform/notifications.ts` | unit tests |
| The sales queue is exactly the roles holding `quote.prepare` | `src/platform/notifications.ts` | unit tests |
| Every project carries an owner, whichever path created it | `src/platform/projects.ts` | unit tests |
| A quotation moves only through the lifecycle, never by setting a status | `src/app/pages/QuoteDetail.tsx` | browser walkthrough |
| Changing currency converts amounts, never relabels them | `src/quoting/quote.ts` | unit tests |
| A customer's stage advances with the work and never retreats | `src/platform/stages.ts` | unit tests |
| Only the demonstration workspace is seeded | `src/platform/auth.tsx` | code; needs a live signup |
| A customer sees only their own records | `src/platform/workspace.tsx`, `firestore.rules` | rules tests |
| Pricing requires a verified email | `src/platform/types.ts`, `firestore.rules` | rules tests |
| A role cannot be minted — invitation names it, or it is `customer` | `firestore.rules` | rules tests |
| Audit trail append-only, under the writer's own name | `firestore.rules` | rules tests |
| Sizing reproduces the supplied workbooks | `src/sizing/`, `src/catalog/pricing.ts` | 103 unit tests |
| The studio checks against the project's converter, not a placeholder | `src/platform/studioBridge.ts` | unit tests |
| A studio lesson reads the live model, never fixed copy | `src/domain/learn.ts`, `src/domain/tour.ts` | unit tests |
| Every design-review finding has an explanation | `src/domain/learn.ts` | unit test reads the codes out of the model |
| Every mechanical assumption has an explanation | `src/domain/learn.ts` | unit test reads the keys out of the schema |
| The guided walk never narrates routing the view is hiding | `src/domain/tour.ts` | unit tests |
| A path trace lights only the path that was asked for | `src/geometry/primitives.ts` | unit tests |
| The site never overlaps two units, and everything placed sits inside the plot | `src/geometry/site.ts` | unit tests |
| The site is laid out at the selected product's dimensions, modelled interior or not | `src/geometry/site.ts`, `src/app/pages/Studio.tsx` | unit tests |
| Augmentation units have a reserved pad on the plot from day one | `src/geometry/site.ts` | unit tests |
| A site is drawn as shells, never as a fleet of full assemblies | `src/geometry/site.ts` | unit test bounds the box count |
| Nothing white-labelled says the demonstration tenant's name | `src/state/store.ts`, `src/scene/Viewer.tsx` | code; browser walkthrough |
| The studio fits the viewport on a 1440×800 laptop | `app/globals.css`, `src/style.css` | browser measurement |

Baseline commands:

```bash
npm run test        # 198 unit tests
npm run test:rules  # 41 Firestore rules tests, against the emulator
npm run build       # static export

## S0 — Baseline and acceptance contract

**State:** READY FOR ACCEPTANCE — review pending
**Revision:** see the commit carrying this file
**Depends on:** —

### 1. Scope

Delivered: baseline audit of the application against `SITE.md`; the harness for every later stage;
the four decisions of 22 Sep implemented and covered (single-level approval, GCloud VM target, 2D
first, 3D unchanged).

Deferred: nothing in S0. S10 deferred by decision, recorded above.

### 2. Environment

Node v22.22.2 · Next 16.3.5 · vitest 4.1.11 · @firebase/rules-unit-testing 5.0.2 ·
firebase-tools 15.30.2 · Firestore emulator 1.22.0 on OpenJDK 21 · Chromium via playwright-core.

### 3. Checks

| Check | Command | Expected | Observed | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Typecheck | `npx tsc --noEmit` | clean | clean | **PASS** |
| Unit suite | `npm run test` | all pass | **110 passed** | **PASS** |
| Rules suite | `npm run test:rules` | all pass | **38 passed** | **PASS** |
| Static export | `npm run build` | 14 routes | 14 routes | **PASS** |
| Opening experience unchanged | browser | landing → *BESS Studio* | as expected | **PASS** |
| Build sequence unchanged | browser | five named steps, then the workbench | five steps, lands on the project | **PASS** |
| Single-level release | browser | one account: draft → issued | **Issue quotation** → `sent` | **PASS** |
| Release does not claim approval | record | `issuedBy` set, `approvedBy` null | `{"issuedBy":"Demo Engineer","approvedBy":null}` | **PASS** |
| Offer carries internal approval | browser | block present on page 4 | present | **PASS** |
| Offer fits A4, **every** quote | browser | 0 overflow on all four pages | 0 across all three seeded quotes | **PASS** |

### 4. Browser walkthrough

`scratchpad/s0.mjs` — landing, build sequence, single-level release, offer document.
`scratchpad/fitall.mjs` — page fit across every seeded quotation.
No page errors and no console errors in any run.

### 5. Defects

| # | Defect | Severity | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | The internal approval block pushed offer page 4 over A4 by 77px | major — introduced in this stage | **fixed**; page margin and block layout reworked |
| D2 | Page-4 fit is **data-dependent** — tuning to one quotation left another 11px over | major — would have shipped as an intermittent bug | **fixed**; now measured across every seeded quote, worst case 0 |
| D3 | `issue` first wrote `approvedByUid`, claiming an approval nobody gave, and the rules refused it | major | **fixed**; separate `issuedBy`/`issuedAt` fields |

Baseline defects carried forward, not introduced here: §10 of `SITE.md` — no sales queue, no
notifications, no password reset. **These are S1's scope.** None affects safety, data integrity or
permissions, so none blocks a later stage.

### 6. Demonstration and rollback

Demo: `npm run dev` → landing → **Start building** → build sequence → project → **Create
quotation** → **Issue quotation** → **Offer document** → print.
Rollback: `git revert` the S0 commit. No migrations; `approvalMode` is absent on existing
organizations and reads as `single`.

### 7. Decision

**READY FOR ACCEPTANCE — review pending.** Next eligible stage: **S1 — finish the quoting tool**.

> **S2 is blocked on information, not code:** the GCloud Terraform environment is not in this
> repository and I have no record of it. Repository, path and VM shape needed before S2 is planned.

---

## S1 — Finish the quoting tool

**State:** READY FOR ACCEPTANCE — review pending
**Revision:** see the commit carrying this file
**Depends on:** S0 (READY FOR ACCEPTANCE)

### 1. Scope

Delivered — R01: the sales queue, notifications, password reset.

- **Sales queue** at `/app/queue`, in the staff navigation. Waiting enquiries **oldest first**, so
  the first of the day is not the last seen, with how long each has waited. Work in hand listed
  separately. Two tiles: waiting, in hand.
- **Notifications** — a bell with an unread count, and a panel. Items are **derived** from the
  quotations already being watched rather than stored: no new collection, no extra Firestore reads,
  and nothing that can go stale. Only a single `notificationsSeenAt` timestamp is written, and only
  when the panel is opened.
- **Password reset** on the sign-in form, via Firebase.

Deferred: email notification (needs a mail sender; see §10 of `SITE.md`). Assignment and SLA on the
queue — not in R01.

### 2. Environment

As S0. No new runtime dependencies.

### 3. Checks

| Check | Command | Expected | Observed | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Typecheck | `npx tsc --noEmit` | clean | clean | **PASS** |
| Unit suite | `npm run test` | all pass | **130 passed** (+20) | **PASS** |
| Rules suite | `npm run test:rules` | all pass | **41 passed** (+3) | **PASS** |
| Build | `npm run build` | `/app/queue` present | 15 routes incl. `/app/queue` | **PASS** |
| Customer submits → queue | browser | 1 waiting, tiles 1/0 | 1 waiting, tiles 1/0 | **PASS** |
| Queue shows waiting time | browser | a duration | `0 min` | **PASS** |
| Bell counts, opens, clears | browser | 1 → item listed → 0 after opening | 1 → *New enquiry · JW-Q-2026-0001* → 0 | **PASS** |
| Pick up moves it | browser | tiles 0/1 | tiles 0/1 | **PASS** |
| Customer cannot reach the queue | browser | blocked, no nav link | *"Not your queue"*, 0 nav links | **PASS** |
| Password reset offered | browser | present on sign-in | present | **PASS** |
| Reset does not reveal whether an account exists | unit + code | same reply either way | same reply; `user-not-found` mapped to it | **PASS** |
| **S0 regression** | browser | opening experience, build sequence, single-level release, offer fit | all unchanged, 0 overflow on every quote | **PASS** |

**Negative cases covered by unit tests:** a customer is not told about their own submission; a
customer never sees another customer's record; no customer name leaks into a customer's own
notification; only an approver is told something awaits approval; a draft generates nothing; the
exact last-seen instant reads as seen, not unread; a future-skewed clock never reads negative.

### 4. Browser walkthrough

`scratchpad/s1.mjs` — the full customer → queue → bell → pick-up path, plus the customer being
refused the queue. `scratchpad/s0.mjs` and `scratchpad/fitall.mjs` re-run as regression. No page or
console errors in any run.

**One result worth explaining, because it looks wrong and is not:** on submitting, the customer's
bell showed **1**. That is a *Quotation issued* notification for a different quotation the demo seed
already gives them in `sent`. It is their own record. The unit tests assert separately that a
customer is never notified of their own submission and never sees another customer's record.

### 5. Defects

| # | Defect | Severity | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D4 | The notification test helper dropped its overrides, so twelve tests exercised an empty fixture and failed | minor — in the test, not the code | **fixed** |
| D5 | A test asserted every non-viewer staff role gets a queue; `engineer` deliberately has no `quote.prepare` | minor — wrong premise in the test | **fixed**; the test now asserts the queue set *equals* the permission set, so the two cannot drift |

No defects in shipped behaviour. Baseline defects from S0 unchanged.

### 6. Demonstration and rollback

Demo: sign in → **Queue** in the sidebar. As a customer, submit a design; as sales, watch it arrive,
open the bell, pick it up, and see it move to *In hand*.
Rollback: `git revert` the S1 commit. No migrations; `notificationsSeenAt` is absent on existing
members and reads as "nothing seen".

### 7. Decision

**READY FOR ACCEPTANCE — review pending.** Next eligible stage: **S2 — model contracts and
evidence**, currently **BLOCKED**: the GCloud Terraform environment is not in this repository and I
have no record of it. Repository, path and VM shape needed before S2 can be planned.
